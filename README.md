# moore_visual_detection

----------------------------------------------------\
% Notes from November 19th Meeting

Ian added noise correlation code for pairwise cells

Dan added the signal correlation and NC x SC

Ian will run rSignal, rNoise, OSI across data set

Dan will work with correlations on one session
- we will use github

----------------------------------------------------
% Notes from December 2nd 2020 Meeting

Days 1-7 learning - Ian will code NC VS SC for first 
and last day 

Clustering through different learning mechanisms
- eigenvalues clusters change with learning

Contrast involved - Dan will implement contrast as 
opposed to orientation 

Hit Miss CR FA - we should analyze data in terms of 
these trial types

Behavior GitHub script -  Ian will add code to parse 
the behavior

Upcoming Analyses = 
- Neurometric Function
- Psychometric Function

Contrast Bins ~ 1-5, 10-30, 50-100

----------------------------------------------------
% Notes from December 8th 2020 Meeting

Added behavioral code for parsing hit and miss data 

Noise correlation of hit and miss cells and OSI

Dan is going to add contrast 
- compare learning of contrast vs. orientation
- psychometric function

Ian will pull slope and intercept of NCxSC plots over
the data set

----------------------------------------------------
% Notes from January 14th 2021 Meeting

Ian added code for neurometric and psychometric functions
- neurometric functions are going to be changed to be z scored

Dan is looking at the trial cross correlation instead of mean

We are going to add SC x NC across each days of training

Ian is working on getting all data to the cluster
- the current data set does not have all days in a row
- current data is pulled from sessions with 100 trials
