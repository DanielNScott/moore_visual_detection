Clustering through different learning mechanisms
- eigenvalues clusters change with learning

Contrast involved - Dan will implement contrast as 
opposed to orientation 

Hit Miss CR FA - we should analyze data in terms of 
these trial types

Behavior GitHub script -  Ian will add code to parse 
the behavior
